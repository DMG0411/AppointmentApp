# AppointmentApp in PHP using Laravel Framework
A simple web application where you can book a consulting appointment. You can choose the consultant and desired day and after that you will see the available hours. An appointment lasts one hour and after one a 30 mins break. The activity program is 9:00 - 13:00 and 15:30 - 21:00. I considered that 12:30 and 20:30 appointments shouldn't not exist in select menu because it won't finish until the program ends.
